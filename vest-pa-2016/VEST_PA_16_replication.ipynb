    "Election results from the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's office via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-pa/). Precinct data was corrected with canvass reports for the following counties: Cumberland, Elk, Lancaster, Northampton, Susquehanna. The candidate totals for Northampton and Susquehanna differ from the county totals reported by the state and therefore the statewide totals differ from the official results accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allegheny County reported president-only votes countywide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The shapefiles from Delaware County and the City of Pittsburgh are from the respective jurisdictions instead. Precinct numbers were corrected to match the voter file in the following locales: Allegheny (Elizabeth, Pittsburgh W12), Blair (Greenfield), Bradford (Athens), Greene (Nonongahela), Monroe (Smithfield), Montgomery (Hatfield), Northampton (Bethlehem Twp), Perry (Toboyne), Washington (New Eagle, Somerset), York (Fairview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Precinct boundaries throughout the state were edited to match voter assignments in the PA Secretary of State voter file from the 2016 election cycle. While some edits reflect official updates to wards or divisions the great majority involve voters incorrectly assigned to voting districts by the counties. As such the VEST shapefile endeavors to reflect the de facto precinct boundaries and these often differ from the official voting district boundaries, in some cases quite drastically. Wherever possible edits were made using census boundaries or alternatively using the parcel shapefiles from the respective counties. \n",
    "\n",
    "In certain areas voter assignments appear so erratic that it is impractical to place all voters within their assigned precinct. These areas were edited so as to place as many voters as possible within their assigned precinct without displacing a greater number from their assigned precinct. In general, municipal boundaries were retained except where significant numbers of numbers were misassigned to the wrong municipality. In cases where the odd/even split was incorrectly reversed for precinct boundary streets the official boundary was retained. All such cases involved near equal number of voters swapped between voting districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following revisions were made to the base shapefiles to match the de facto 2016 precinct boundaries consistent with the voter file. Individual precincts are noted in cases of splits or merges. Due to the sheer number of edits boundary adjustments are noted at the borough/township level. There may be as many as two dozen individual precincts that were revised within a given municipality.\n",
