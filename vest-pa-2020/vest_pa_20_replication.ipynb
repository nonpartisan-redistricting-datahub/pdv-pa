    "#### Election Results\n",
    "Election results primarily from individual county precinct reports as processed via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-pa/). Precinct data was corrected with canvass reports for the following counties: Cambria, Crawford, Forest, Juniata, York. The Susquehanna County precinct results were provided by the Pennsylvania Secretary of State Bureau of Elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to court orders involving ballots that were segregated until legal challenges were resolved the certified results from nearly all counties differ from the official results certified by the state. State courts ordered segregated ballots to be included for state offices whereas federal courts ordered that they be excluded for federal offices. As the orders were issued after the county certification deadline these votes were added to the state offices for 57 counties that did not include them in precinct reports and removed from federal offices in 10 counties that did include them in precinct reports. The precinct results in the VEST shapefiles are those that were certified by the respective counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal ballots in Philadelphia were reported at the citywide level. These are distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shapefiles\n",
    "Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The shapefiles from Delaware County and the City of Pittsburgh are from the respective jurisdictions. Precinct numbers were corrected to match the 2020 voter file in the following locales: Allegheny (Elizabeth, Pittsburgh W12), Blair (Greenfield), Bradford (Athens), Greene (Dunkard, Monongahela), Monroe (Smithfield), Montgomery (Hatfield), Northampton (Bethlehem Twp), Perry (Toboyne), Union (Union), Washington (New Eagle, Somerset), York (Fairview). VTD codes in Philadelphia were edited to match the city ward/division numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Census Bureau's final VTD release was used for all of Crawford, Jefferson, McKean, Northumberland. A number of precincts statewide were also replaced with the final VTDs due to updated municipal boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final VTD release was also used for precincts that were altered before the 2020 general election in the following locales: Adams (Reading), Allegheny (Marshall), Armstrong (Ford City), Cambria (N Cambria), Centre (State College), Chester (Valley N), Clearfield (Bradford), Franklin (Montgomery, Peters), Greene (Dunkard), Lebanon (Cornwall, Jackson, N Cornwall, S Londonderry, Swatara), Luzerne (Butler, Dallas, Fairview, Kingston Boro, Kingston Twp, Rice, Salem, Sugarloaf, Wright), Lycoming (Williamsport), Mercer (S Pymatuning), Monroe (Jackson), Montgomery (New Hanover, Upper Merion), Northampton (Allen), Philadelphia (Wards 2, 5, 8, 18, 21, 40, 63), Venango (Cranberry), Washington (Amwell, Cecil, Donegal, N Strabane, S Strabane); Westmoreland: (Murrysville), York (W Manheim).\n",
    "\n",
    "Precinct boundaries throughout the state were edited to match voter assignments in the PA Secretary of State voter file from the 2020 election cycle. While some edits reflect official updates to wards or divisions the majority involve voters incorrectly assigned to voting districts by the counties. As such the VEST shapefile endeavors to reflect the de facto precinct boundaries and these often differ from the official voting district boundaries in some cases quite drastically. Wherever possible edits were made using census boundaries or alternatively using the parcel shapefiles from the respective counties. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "In certain areas voter assignments appear so erratic that it is impractical to place all voters within their assigned precinct. These areas were edited so as to place as many voters as possible within their assigned precinct without displacing a greater number from their assigned precinct. In general, municipal boundaries were retained except where a significant number of voters were misassigned to the wrong municipality. In cases where the odd/even split was incorrectly reversed for precinct boundary streets the official boundary was retained. All such cases involved near equal number of voters swapped between voting districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following revisions were made to the base shapefiles to match the de facto 2020 precinct boundaries consistent with the voter file. Individual precincts are noted in cases of splits or merges. Due to the sheer number of edits boundary adjustments are listed at the borough/township level. There may be as many as two dozen individual precincts that were revised within a given municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases the edited precinct boundaries noted below match those of the final Census VTD release.\n",
